# miller_indices_visualizer
MATLAB tool which visualized miller indices in a 3D cubic structure, also computers lattice parameter and diffraction angle when given interplanar spacing and wavelength by user.
User input was carefully managed using simple error checks. Implemented file I/O using save, load, fopen, fclose, xlsread, xlswrite, supporting reading/writing to .mat, .txt, and .xlsx files. This enables seamless data import and export for potential data analysis/reporting.
